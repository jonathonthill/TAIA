take a closer look membranes form let's take a closer look membranes form let's take a closer look at their structure membranes are made of at their structure membranes are made of at their structure membranes are made of two layers of phospholipids two layers of phospholipids two layers of phospholipids phospholipids have a glycerol backbone phospholipids have a glycerol backbone phospholipids have a glycerol backbone composed of three carbons with composed of three carbons with composed of three carbons with functional groups attached two of the functional groups attached two of the functional groups attached two of the carbons are linked to long chains of carbons are linked to long chains of carbons are linked to long chains of hydrocarbons making one side of the hydrocarbons making one side of the hydrocarbons making one side of the molecule hydrophobic the fatty acid molecule hydrophobic the fatty acid molecule hydrophobic the fatty acid chains can have different lengths and chains can have different lengths and chains can have different lengths and degrees of saturation which allows for degrees of saturation which allows for degrees of saturation which allows for variation in the rigidity of the variation in the rigidity of the variation in the rigidity of the membrane the third carbon has a membrane the third carbon has a membrane the third carbon has a phosphate group attached making it phosphate group attached making it phosphate group attached making it charged in hydrophilic the phosphate charged in hydrophilic the phosphate charged in

the protein jostles Brownian motion so the protein jostles around in the channel around in the channel around in the channel this causes new regions to emerge in the this causes new regions to emerge in the this causes new regions to emerge in the ER lumen and as soon as a new portion of ER lumen and as soon as a new portion of ER lumen and as soon as a new portion of the protein enters the ER bit put binds the protein enters the ER bit put binds the protein enters the ER bit put binds and prevents it from reversing back out and prevents it from reversing back out and prevents it from reversing back out over time the jostling of the peptide over time the jostling of the peptide over time the jostling of the peptide and the binding of bit pulls the peptide and the binding of bit pulls the peptide and the binding of bit pulls the peptide into the ER this kind of transport into the ER this kind of transport into the ER this kind of transport system is called a ratchet and shows up system is called a ratchet and shows up system is called a ratchet and shows up in other types of protein transport in in other types of protein transport in in other types of protein transport in the cell in this case pulling the the cell in this case pulling the the cell in this case pulling the peptide into the ER does not require peptide into the ER does not require peptide into the ER does not require energy but releasing the strong bond energy but releasing the strong bond energy but releasing the strong bond between BIP and the protein uses energy between BIP and the protein uses energy between BIP and the protein uses energy from ATP hydrolysis from ATP hydrolysis from ATP hydrolysis though post-translational translocation though post-translational translocation though post-translational translocation is similar to other types of protein is similar to other types of protein is similar to other types of protein transport it is not the most common form transport it is not the most common form transport it is not the most common form of import into the ER the more common of import into the ER the more common of import into the ER the more common mode is code translational translocation mode is code translational translocation mode is code translational translocation which involves the transport of proteins which involves the transport of proteins which involves the transport of proteins into the ER as they are being into the ER as they are being into the ER as they are being synthesized this is possible because the synthesized this is possible because the synthesized this is possible because the ER has ribosomes covering its surface ER has ribosomes covering its surface ER has ribosomes covering its surface that can synthesize proteins directly that can synthesize proteins directly that can synthesize proteins directly into the sex 61 channel so translation into the sex 61 channel so translation into the sex 61 channel so translation and translocation happen concurrently and translocation happen concurrently and translocation happen concurrently like proteins imported like proteins imported like proteins imported post-translationally these proteins have post-translationally these proteins have post-translationally these proteins have a zip code made of a region of a zip code made of a region of a zip code made of a region of hydrophobic amino acids with hydrophilic hydrophobic amino acids with hydrophilic hydrophobic amino acids with hydrophilic regions on either end regions on either end regions on either end however unlike post translational however unlike post translational however unlike post translational transport this sequence is almost always transport this sequence is almost always transport this sequence is almost always found at the end terminus and is cleaved found at the end terminus and is cleaved found at the end terminus and is cleaved from all secreted proteins and many from all secreted proteins and many from all secreted proteins and many transmembrane proteins by protein called transmembrane proteins by protein called transmembrane proteins by protein called signal peptidase so this sequence may signal peptidase so this sequence may signal peptidase so this sequence may not appear in the final protein encodes not appear in the final protein encodes not appear in the final protein encodes lai tional transport the signal sequence lai tional transport the signal sequence lai tional transport the signal sequence is first bound by a protein called the is first bound by a protein called the is first bound by a protein called the signal recognition particle or SRP SRP signal recognition particle or SRP SRP signal recognition particle or SRP SRP has three binding domains the first has three binding domains the first has three binding domains the first domain binds the signal sequence as soon domain binds the signal sequence as soon domain binds the signal sequence as soon as it is translated the second binds the as it is translated the second binds the as it is translated the second binds the ribosome stopping translation and the ribosome stopping translation and the ribosome stopping translation and the third binds an SRP receptor located in third binds an SRP receptor located in third binds an SRP receptor located in the ER membrane near this x61 channel at the ER membrane near this x61 channel at the ER membrane near this x61 channel at this point this ecstasy one channel this point this ecstasy one channel this point this ecstasy one channel binds the signal sequence causing SRP to binds the signal sequence causing SRP to binds the signal sequence causing SRP to dissociate once SRP disengages the dissociate once SRP disengages the dissociate once SRP disengages the ribosome continues translating the ribosome continues translating the ribosome continues translating the peptide directly into the ER lumen peptide directly into the ER lumen peptide directly into the ER lumen as you can see this xst one translocon as you can see this xst one translocon as you can see this xst one translocon plays an important role in protein plays an important role in protein plays an important role in protein transport across the ER membrane but transport across the ER membrane but transport across the ER membrane but this is not it's only function the sexy this is not it's only function the sexy this is not it's only function the sexy one channel has a hinge that can open one channel has a hinge that can open one channel has a hinge that can open during translocation causing the protein during translocation causing the protein during translocation causing the protein to slip out and insert into the ER to slip out and insert into the ER to slip out and insert into the ER membrane this happens whenever a membrane this happens whenever a membrane this happens whenever a transmembrane domain enters the channel transmembrane domain enters the channel transmembrane domain enters the channel transmembrane domains are hydrophobic transmembrane domains are hydrophobic transmembrane domains are hydrophobic regions about twenty to twenty-five regions about twenty to twenty-five regions about twenty to twenty-five amino acids long all proteins destined amino acids long all proteins destined amino acids long all proteins destined for the ER have at least one of these for the ER have at least one of these for the ER have at least one of these domains because the signal sequence domains because the signal sequence domains because the signal sequence itself is hydrophobic itself is hydrophobic itself is hydrophobic however transmembrane proteins often however transmembrane proteins often however transmembrane proteins often have multiple transmembrane domains once have multiple transmembrane domains once have multiple transmembrane domains once inserted into the ER membrane these inserted into the ER membrane these inserted into the ER membrane these proteins maintain their orientation proteins maintain their orientation proteins maintain their orientation throughout their transport in the ER and throughout their transport in the ER and throughout their transport in the ER and Golgi this means that the same region of Golgi this means that the same region of Golgi this means that the same region of the protein facing the cytosol in the ER the protein facing the cytosol in the ER the protein facing the cytosol in the ER will face the cytosol when it arrives at will face the cytosol when it arrives at will face the cytosol when it arrives at its final destination therefore it is its final destination therefore it is its final destination therefore it is essential that these domains are essential that these domains are essential that these domains are inserted into the ER membrane with a inserted into the ER membrane with a inserted into the ER membrane with a very specific orientation this very specific orientation this very specific orientation this orientation is determined by the charge orientation is determined by the charge orientation is determined by the charge of the amino acids on either side of the of the amino acids on either side of the of the amino acids on either side of the signal sequence the ER lumen stores signal sequence the ER lumen stores signal sequence the ER lumen stores calcium ions which gives it a net calcium ions which gives it a net calcium ions which gives it a net positive charge while the cytosol positive charge while the cytosol positive charge while the cytosol maintains a net negative charge maintains a net negative charge maintains a net negative charge positively charged amino acids will positively charged amino acids will positively charged amino acids will preferentially orient towards the preferentially orient towards the preferentially orient towards the cytosol while negatively charged amino cytosol while negatively charged amino cytosol while negatively charged amino acids will be positioned in the yard acids will be positioned in the yard acids will be positioned in the yard lumen it might help to think of this lumen it might help to think of this lumen it might help to think of this like a needle and thread if you're like a needle and thread if you're like a needle and thread if you're familiar with sewing you know that you familiar with sewing you know that you familiar with sewing you know that you usually start by tying a knot you thread usually start by tying a knot you thread usually start by tying a knot you thread the needle through the fabric in a the needle through the fabric in a the needle through the fabric in a direction that places that not on a direction that places that not on a direction that places that not on a specific side of the fabric then the specific side of the fabric then the specific side of the fabric then the thread is pulled through when the needle thread is pulled through when the needle thread is pulled through when the needle passes through the fabric again it passes through the fabric again it passes through the fabric again it causes a loop of string to form on one causes a loop of string to form on one causes a loop of string to form on one side this process repeats in the site side this process repeats in the site side this process repeats in the site the thread is on alternates with each the thread is on alternates with each the thread is on alternates with each stitch this is similar to the multi pass stitch this is similar to the multi pass stitch this is similar to the multi pass membrane protein in this analogy the membrane protein in this analogy the membrane protein in this analogy the n-terminus of the protein is like the n-terminus of the protein is like the n-terminus of the protein is like the knot it is positioned so that it extends knot it is positioned so that it extends knot it is positioned so that it extends either into the ER or into the cytosol either into the ER or into the cytosol either into the ER or into the cytosol anchoring the protein on the membrane anchoring the protein on the membrane anchoring the protein on the membrane then the growing peptide extends out then the growing peptide extends out then the growing peptide extends out like a thread until a second like a thread until a second like a thread until a second transmembrane domain slips out of the transmembrane domain slips out of the transmembrane domain slips out of the channel forming a loop the peptide then channel forming a loop the peptide then channel forming a loop the peptide then begins extending on the opposite side of begins extending on the opposite side of begins extending on the opposite side of the membrane and this alternating the membrane and this alternating the membrane and this alternating pattern continues each time a pattern continues each time a pattern continues each time a transmembrane domain enters the channel transmembrane domain enters the channel transmembrane domain enters the channel like the placement of the knot in the like the placement of the knot in the like

transported into the ER one of two ways code translationally or post code translationally or post code translationally or post translationally in post-translational translationally in post-translational translationally in post-translational translocation peptides are synthesized translocation peptides are synthesized translocation peptides are synthesized completely in the cytoplasm bound by completely in the cytoplasm bound by completely in the cytoplasm bound by chaperones and then translocated into chaperones and then translocated into chaperones and then
