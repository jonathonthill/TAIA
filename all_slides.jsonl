Since information about the third dimension is lost upon sectioning, how, then, can we get a picture of the three-dimensional architecture of a cell or tissue, and how can we view the microscopic structure of a specimen that, for one reason or another, cannot first be sliced into sections?  Additionally, although an optical microscope is focused on a particular focal plane within a three-dimensional specimen, all the other parts of the specimen, above and below the plane of focus, are also illuminated and the light originating from these regions contributes to the image as out of focus (it looks blurry).  This can make it very hard to interpret the image in detail and can lead to fine image structure being obscured by the out-of-focus light. \nTwo distinct but complementary approaches solve this problem.  One is computational, the other optical.  These three-dimensional microscopic imaging methods make it possible to focus on a chosen plane in a thick specimen while rejecting the light that comes from out-of-focus regions above and below that plane.  Thus one sees a crisp, thin optical section.  From a series of such optical sections taken at different depths and stored in a computer, a three dimensional image can be reconstructed.  The methods do for the microscopist what the computed tomography (CT) scanner does for the radiologist investigating the human body: both machines give detailed sectional views of the interior of the intact structure.

This way, the cells can take up materials from the outside and concentrate them into vesicles.

Specificity is determine by proteins found on the surface of the vesicle and the target membrane. Two sets of proteins are responsible for this job. Rab proteins and Rab effectors. The distribution of Rab proteins is highly specific. They are ideal for marking specific membrane compartments. Like coat-recruitment GTPases (think of Sar1 from last lecture), they float around the cytoplasm in an inactive GDP-bound state. When they are activated, they associate with the target membrane or vesicle membrane through an exposed lipid anchor. Once activated, Rab-GTPases recruit Rab effector proteins.

These probes are very difficult to make, but are powerful tools once made. Resonance transfer is exceptionally sensitive to distance and only works if the two molecules are right next to each other. Hence, this method can be used to watch proteins interacting in real-time.\n\nRemember that fluorescence occurs when a molecule absorbs/is excited by light at one wavelength, but emits light at a different wavelength. We can examine potential protein interactions by placing different fluorescent markers on each protein. In the example above, protein X has been labeled with CFP, and protein Y has been labeled with GFP. When CFP is excited by violet light, it emits blue light . The blue light that CFP emits is the same wavelength that GFP absorbs.

E1 uses ATP to make a covalent bond with a ubiquitin (on one of its cysteines). E1 then transfers the ubiquitin to an E2. This does not require ATP. Thus E1 proteins function in covalently loading E2 proteins with ubiquitin. E2 proteins then transfer the ubiquitin to the target protein, where they are covalently attached to lysines. E2 proteins are brought to the correct target by an adaptor protein, E3, that binds the E2 with one domain and the target by the other domain. E3 proteins thus specify the target of ubiquitination by the E2 protein, but never touch the ubiquitin themselves. The original ubiquitin modification is further modified by the addition, repetitively, of other ubiquitins, making a chain. In this chain, the first ubiquitin is attached covalently to a lysine of the target proteins. The next ubiquitin is covalently attached to a lysine in this first ubiquitin. The next ubiquitin is similarly attached to the second ubiquitin, and so on. \n\nE1 = Ubiquitin-activating enzyme\nE2 = Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme\nE3 = Ubiquitin ligase\n\nNote: There is also a special protein, called an E4, that can nonspecifically extend chains during cell division.", "file": "11-Protein Homeostasis_JH.F2022.pptx", "match_score": 0, "full_text": "ubiquitination process by repeated interactions with e3 or by e4 know this process ubiquitin is covalently added to proteins on lysines in a series of steps that are driven by e1 through e3 proteins e1 uses atp to make a covalent bond with a ubiquitin on one of its cysteines e1 then transfers the ubiquitin to an e2 this does not require atp thus e1 proteins function in covalently loading e2 proteins with ubiquitin e2 proteins then transfer the ubiquitin to the target protein where they are covalently attached to lysines e2 proteins are brought to the correct target by an adaptor protein e3 that binds the e2 with one domain and the target by the other domain e3 proteins thus specify the target of ubiquitination by the e2 protein but never touch the ubiquitin themselves the original ubiquitin modification is further modified by the addition repetitively of other ubiquitins making a chain in this chain the first ubiquitin is attached covalently to a lysine of the target proteins the next ubiquitin is covalently attached to a lysine in this first ubiquitin the next ubiquitin is similarly attached to the second ubiquitin and so on \n\ne1  ubiquitinactivating enzyme\ne2  ubiquitinconjugating enzyme\ne3  ubiquitin ligase\n\nnote there is also a special protein called an e4 that can nonspecifically extend chains during cell division"}

In the endogenous bacterial system, if tetracycline, or one of its analogs like doxycycline, are present, tetR will bind to tetracycline and not to the TRE, permitting transcription.\nTetracycline-dependent promoters are developed by placing a TRE upstream of a minimal promoter.\nTetracycline Off System\nThe initial system Gossen and Bujard developed is known as tetracycline off: in the presence of tetracycline, expression from a tet-inducible promoter is reduced. To use tetracycline as a regulator of gene expression, a tetracycline-controlled transactivator (tTA) was developed. tTA was created by fusing tetR with the C-terminal domain of VP16 (virion protein 16), an essential transcriptional activation domain from HSV (herpes simplex virus).\nIn the absence of tetracycline, the tetR portion of tTA will bind these tetO sequences and the activation domain promotes expression. In the presence of tetracycline, tetracycline binds to tetR. This precludes tTA binding to the tetO sequences and subsequent increase in expression by the activation domain, resulting in reduced gene expression. This idea of a hybrid transactivator was initially used with the lac system. Tetracycline off is also known as the tTA-dependent system.\n\u000bTetracycline On System\n\u000bIn Gossen et al (1995)\u00a0, random mutagenesis was used to identify which amino acid residues of tetR were important for tetracycline-dependent repression. Mutating these residues led to the development of a reverse Tet repressor, or rTetR, which reversed the phenotype and created a reliance on the presence of tetracycline for induction, rather than repression. The new transactivator rtTA (\u00a0reverse\u00a0tetracycline-controlled\u00a0transactivator) was created by fusing rTetR with VP16. The tetracycline on system is also known as the rtTA-dependent system.\nExperimental Tips\nChoosing a tet system\nIf your gene of interest should be active, and only turned off occasionally, using tetracycline off or tTA is more appropriate.\nIf your gene of interest should be mostly inactive, and only turned on occasionally, using tetracycline on or rtTA is more appropriate.\nBasic components\nComponents for a tetracycline off system are:\nPlasmid containing a tetracycline-dependent promoter upstream of your gene of interest\ntTA expression plasmid\nComponents for a tetracycline on system are:\nPlasmid containing a tetracycline-dependent promoter upstream of your gene of interest\nrtTA or TetR expression plasmid\nStable cell lines can be made that continuously express a system component (e.g. tTA).", "file": "21-Phagocytosis and Pinocytosis.F2022.pptx", "match_score": 0, "full_text": "teton and tetoff  tet system and the tet response element tre\na tre is 7 repeats of a 19 nucleotide tetracycline operator teto sequence and is recognized by the tetracycline repressor tetr in the endogenous bacterial system if tetracycline or one of its analogs like doxycycline are present tetr will bind to tetracycline and not to the tre permitting transcription\ntetracyclinedependent promoters are developed by placing a tre upstream of a minimal promoter\ntetracycline off system\nthe initial system gossen and bujard developed is known as tetracycline off in the presence of tetracycline expression from a tetinducible promoter is reduced to use tetracycline as a regulator of gene expression a tetracyclinecontrolled transactivator tta was developed tta was created by fusing tetr with the cterminal domain of vp16 virion protein 16 an essential transcriptional activation domain from hsv herpes simplex virus\nin the absence of tetracycline the tetr portion of tta will bind these teto sequences and the activation domain promotes expression in the presence of tetracycline tetracycline binds to tetr this precludes tta binding to the teto sequences and subsequent increase in expression by the activation domain resulting in reduced gene expression this idea of a hybrid transactivator was initially used with the lac system tetracycline off is also known as the ttadependent system\n\u000btetracycline on system\n\u000bin gossen et al 1995\u00a0 random mutagenesis was used to identify which amino acid residues of tetr were important for tetracyclinedependent repression mutating these residues led to the development of a reverse tet repressor or rtetr which reversed the phenotype and created a reliance on the presence of tetracycline for induction rather than repression the new transactivator rtta \u00a0reverse\u00a0tetracyclinecontrolled\u00a0transactivator was created by fusing rtetr with vp16 the tetracycline on system is also known as the rttadependent system\nexperimental tips\nchoosing a tet system\nif your gene of interest should be active and only turned off occasionally using tetracycline off or tta is more appropriate\nif your gene of interest should be mostly inactive and only turned on occasionally using tetracycline on or rtta is more appropriate\nbasic components\ncomponents for a tetracycline off system are\nplasmid containing a tetracyclinedependent promoter upstream of your gene of interest\ntta expression plasmid\ncomponents for a tetracycline on system are\nplasmid containing a tetracyclinedependent promoter upstream of your gene of interest\nrtta or tetr expression plasmid\nstable cell lines can be made that continuously express a system component eg tta"}

{"lecture": "Lecture3", "slide_number": 35, "slide_title": "Affinity Tags", "slide_text": "", "presenter_notes": "If a good antibody is not available, affinity tags can be used instead. Affinity Tags are very similar to epitope tags. The major defining difference is that they do not bind antibodies; they bind other types of proteins. This binding is stronger than a typical antibody/epitope tag interaction, so they are preferred for Co-IP. In this class, we will talk about 3 types: GST tags, His tags, and Biotin tags.\n\nGST \u2013 GST is a small protein that binds glutathione with very high affinity. Elute with excess glutathione.\nHis \u2013 Histidine tags are essentially strings of histidine. Histidines bind Cations (usually nickel) strongly.\nBiotin \u2013 Biotin is a relatively small chemical compound that can bind to protein side chains. The strongest non-covalent binding known is between a protein called streptavidin and Biotin.", "file": "3-Approaches_JH.F2022.pptx", "match_score": 0, "full_text": "affinity tags  if a good antibody is not available affinity tags can be used instead affinity tags are very similar to epitope tags the major defining difference is that they do not bind antibodies they bind other types of proteins this binding is stronger than a typical antibodyepitope tag interaction so they are preferred for coip in this class we will talk about 3 types gst tags his tags and biotin tags\n\ngst \u2013 gst is a small protein that binds glutathione with very high affinity elute with excess glutathione\nhis \u2013 histidine tags are essentially strings of histidine histidines bind cations usually nickel strongly\nbiotin \u2013 biotin is a relatively small chemical compound that can bind to protein side chains the strongest noncovalent binding known is between a protein called streptavidin and biotin"}
